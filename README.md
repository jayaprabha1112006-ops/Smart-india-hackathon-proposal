This repository hosts the architectural proposal for Marinexplore, an AI-driven platform selected for the internal rounds of the Smart India Hackathon 2025. We designed a unified system to automate the ingestion and analysis of oceanographic and biodiversity data using Python (TensorFlow) and React. The included documentation outlines our full system design, from data pipelines to predictive modeling, demonstrating a scalable approach to solving marine data silos.
